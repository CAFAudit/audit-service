# Auditing Library

`caf-audit` is the auditing library that is used to raise audit events. The Java auditing code generated by the [code generation plugin](https://github.hpe.com/caf/caf-audit-maven-plugin) uses this library to send audit events through to Apache Kafka.

## Usage
It is recommended that a client-side library is generated to raise audit events. This should make it easier and safer to raise the events, as it should mean that each event can be raised with a single type-safe call. The generated library should take a dependency on `caf-audit` using the following Maven coordinates:

	<dependencies>
	    <dependency>
	        <groupId>com.hpe.caf</groupId>
	        <artifactId>caf-audit</artifactId>
	        <version>1.1</version>
	    </dependency>
	</dependencies>

## No-op Auditing Library

A dummy implementation of the standard auditing library, `caf-audit`, is also provided to support developers without any Apache Kafka infrastructure. It has the same interface as the standard auditing library but does not send anything to Kafka.

In order to make use of this no-op auditing library, modify the Maven coordinates for the `caf-audit` dependency and specify 1.1-NOOP as the version rather than just 1.1:

	<dependencies>
	    <dependency>
	        <groupId>com.hpe.caf</groupId>
	        <artifactId>caf-audit</artifactId>
	        <version>1.1-NOOP</version>
	    </dependency>
	</dependencies>
