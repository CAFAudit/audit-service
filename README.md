# Audit Management Web Service UI

This is the user-interface for calling the [CAF Audit Management Web Service](https://github.hpe.com/caf/caf-audit-management-service) operations. It allows users to see what operations the web service exposes as well as documentation relating to those operations and the web service in general.

## Usage

To get started, deploy the [web service docker container](https://github.hpe.com/caf/caf-audit-management-service-container). The web service UI can then be accessed at the following URL:

	http://<docker.ip.address>:<port>/caf-audit-management-ui

Replace `<docker.ip.address>` and `<port>` as necessary.
