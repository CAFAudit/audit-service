### Audit Management Web Service Container

#### Configuration

See the configuration for CAF Audit Management Service [here](https://github.hpe.com/caf/caf-audit-management-service-container/blob/develop/configuration/marathon-properties.md).

##### marathon-properties.json

Use the [marathon-properties.json](https://github.hpe.com/caf/caf-audit-management-service-container/blob/develop/configuration/marathon-properties.json) file with marathon loader to deploy the audit-management-web-service. 


#### Launch

Copy the container configuration marathon template folder (i.e. [marathon-template-json](https://github.hpe.com/caf/caf-audit-management-service-container/tree/develop/configuration)) and the corresponding [marathon-properties.json](https://github.hpe.com/caf/caf-audit-management-service-container/blob/develop/configuration/marathon-properties.json) file to the same folder containing the marathon application loader artifact.

To start the Audit Management Web Service container, run the marathon application loader with:

java -jar marathon-loader-2.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar -m "./marathon-template-json" -v "./marathon-properties.json" -e http://localhost:8080 -mo "./marathon-config"

where -e is used to specify the Marathon endpoint

This will launch the container which includes both the Web Service and UI.
