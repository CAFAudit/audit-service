# Audit Web Service UI

This Swagger UI project builds a documentation web application for the [CAF Audit Web Service](https://github.com/CAFAudit/audit-service/tree/develop/caf-audit--service). It allows users to see what operations the web service exposes as well as documentation relating to those operations and the web service in general.

## Usage

To get started, deploy the [web service docker container](https://github.com/CAFAudit/audit-service/tree/develop/caf-audit-management-service-container). The web service UI can then be accessed at the following URL:

	http://<docker.ip.address>:<port>/caf-audit-ui

Replace `<docker.ip.address>` and `<port>` as necessary.
